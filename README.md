# Cooking-Recipies

When starting run this:
. venv/bin/activate


Current things to do:
Update / Fix CSS with proper names for corresponding html id and class names
Get the database functioning
Look into how the database should work with ingredients / steps added as a JS function
How does the username show properly (it should show the user corresponding with the profile / recipe, not necessarily the
    user who is current_user)
Update the Jinja templates to reflect the data stored in the database, not the hardcoded text / images
